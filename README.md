# 💉 Diabetes Data Analysis Project

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a diabetes dataset. It aims to uncover patterns and correlations between health indicators and the likelihood of diabetes diagnosis.

📄 **Final Report**: [diabetes.pdf](./diabetes.pdf)

## 📌 Objectives

The analysis focuses on answering questions like:

- What are the characteristics of patients with diabetes?
- How do features like glucose, insulin, BMI, and age affect diabetes outcomes?
- What are the most influential factors in predicting diabetes?

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Insights

> Full visualizations and analysis are available in [diabetes.pdf](./diabetes.pdf), but here are some highlights:

- 📊 People with **higher glucose levels** and **higher insulin values** are more likely to have diabetes.
- 🧮 **BMI and Age** are also significantly associated with diabetes outcomes.
- 📉 There are patterns where multiple low-health indicators overlap in diabetic cases.
